README for CountryList App
Application Description
CountryList is a web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive list of countries. With its powerful filters, users can search for countries based on certain criteria such as population, name, and more. The application interfaces with an external RESTful Countries API, bringing together a seamless combination of data extraction and user experience. Beyond just displaying countries, the application offers pagination, sorting, and filtering functionalities, ensuring that users can narrow down to the precise list they're seeking with minimal effort.

Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, CountryList is the go-to application for those who wish to explore or learn more about the nations of the world. By leveraging the potential of ASP.NET Core, the application stands out in terms of performance, scalability, and ease of use.

Running the Application Locally
Ensure you have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Navigate to the root directory of the project using your terminal or command prompt.
Restore the project dependencies using the command:
bash
Copy code
dotnet restore
To run the application, use the command:
bash
Copy code
dotnet run
Once running, you can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 or the port displayed in the terminal.
Using the Developed Endpoint
The main endpoint for retrieving countries is the GetCountries endpoint which supports multiple query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination.

Here are 10 examples demonstrating how to use the GetCountries endpoint:

Get the first 10 countries (default behavior):

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries
Search for countries containing the name "India":

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?searchString=India
Fetch countries with a population less than 1 million:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?populationLessThan=1000000
Retrieve the second page of countries with a default page size of 10:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?pageNumber=2
Get 20 countries per page:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?pageSize=20
Sort countries by name:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?sortAttribute=name
Search for countries containing "land" and sort by name:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?searchString=land&sortAttribute=name
Fetch countries with a population less than 500,000 and sort by name:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?populationLessThan=500000&sortAttribute=name
Retrieve the third page of countries with a page size of 5:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?pageNumber=3&pageSize=5
Combine multiple filters: search for countries with "United" in the name, with a population less than 50 million, sorted by name, and get the second page with 15 countries per page:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/Countries/GetCountries?searchString=United&populationLessThan=50000000&sortAttribute=name&pageNumber=2&pageSize=15
Remember to adjust the base URL (http://localhost:5000) accordingly if you're using a different domain or port number.
